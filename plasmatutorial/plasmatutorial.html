        <h1>Here I will show you how to make your KDE plasma look nice!</h1>
        <img src="niceplasma.png" alt="what my KDE plasma looks like" height="1080" width="1920">
        <b>So, are you interested? If yes, follow this tutorial to get a similar result!</b>
        <p>First, you will have to install plasma if you dont have it already. To do this here is a list on how to do it on most Linux distros.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>on debian, do this: sudo apt -y install task-kde-desktop</li>
            <li>on arch, do this: sudo pacman -S plasma</li>
            <li>on fedora, do this: sudo dnf install @kde-desktop</li>
        </ul>
        <p>if you use any of the other distros, you probably are advanced enough to know how to install it either way lol.</p>
        <b>after installing plasma, we can now get to the overall taskbar look.</b>
        <img src="makedock.png" alt="how to get the taskbar layout" height="1080" width="1920">
        <p>Lets begin with the dock. To get it, right click on it and choose edit panel. At first, remove everything except for the task-manager. Also, under more options, set it to center. Then, pull the 2 arrows heading left to the middle.</p>
        <p>After that, you can edit the height according to your preference. Personally, I have it at 25.</p>
        <p>To get the taskbar on top, rightclick on your desktop and choose add panel. After that, choose application menu bar.</p>
        <b>And now you have the overall look! Now, lets go over to widgets.</b>
        <img src="addwidgets.png" alt="where to add widgets" height="1080" width="1920">
        <p>Now, lets get to the widgets. To open a window as shown above, rightclick on the taskbar you want to add widgets to and click on add widgets.</p>
        <p>I personally always add an application menu, a global menu, a digital clock and a system tray.</p>
        <p>After you added those widgets, click on edit panel and configure them as you like. I, obviousely, configure it as shown before. You can add spacers to center things.</p>
        <b>Now you have the most basic resemblance of MacOS. Lets get to theming now.</b>
        <img src="theming.png" alt="how to theme your plasma" height="1080" width="1920">
        <p>This is KDE 5.21. It has a global appearance setting. Here, you can just click on get new global themes and download the one you like.</p>
        <p>Of course, you can also choose a different theme for each subsetting, like colors or icons.</p>
        <h2>And there you have it! Now you have a fully themed plasma desktop. I hope you like it!</h2>
